Session notes - OpenAI coding agent run

What I did in this session:
- Brought the repo to orientation: read app_spec.txt, feature_list.json, claude-progress.txt, and checked Git history.
- Spun up the frontend dev server via init.sh. Frontend running on http://localhost:5173
- Verified UI by loading the app in a browser, then performing a minimal end-to-end test:
  - Created a new conversation
  - Typed a sample message and sent it
  - Observed streaming reply indicator and initial content in the assistant message
- Took screenshots to verify UI visuals:
  - verification/01_home.png
  - verification/01_after_send.png

Current status:
- Core UI loads and basic chat flow works in a SSE-mocked environment.
- No backend connected (backend folder not present); frontend SSE is mocked within UI state.

Next steps:
- Build out more features (e.g., markdown rendering tests, artifact rendering, multi-turn context) in the browser flow.
- Attempt more extensive UI automation against the frontend (image attachments, code artifacts, model switcher).
- If feasible, enable a backend stub and health checks to validate API-endpoint flows.

Completion status: 1/200 tests commented (UI verification performed)
