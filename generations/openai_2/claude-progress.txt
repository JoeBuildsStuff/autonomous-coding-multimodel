Session progress - UI enhancements and scaffolding for Claude.ai Clone

What I accomplished this session:
- Implemented auto-resizing textarea with live character counter in frontend App.jsx
- Wired refs to support auto-resize and focus behavior
- Preserved the existing streaming simulation behavior for UI feedback
- Ran environment bootstrap (init.sh) to prepare a frontend static-serving setup (note: full browser-based verification may require bundling in this sandbox)

Tests attempted (core tests for UI):
- Core chat interface loads and renders a clean chat layout with streaming responses (test #1) – not verifiable in this sandbox due to browser automation bridge limitations

Current status: 1 feature implemented; verification pending

Next steps:
- Re-run Step 3 verification with browser automation when the environment allows
- If tests pass, update feature_list.json: mark the relevant test as true
- Commit and push changes, then update feature progress in claude-progress.txt
