Session progress - UI enhancements and scaffolding for Claude.ai Clone

What I accomplished this session:
- Implemented auto-resizing textarea with live character counter in frontend App.jsx
- Implemented Pause/Resume streaming controls and a paused state in the chat UI
- Wired a Pause button that toggles streaming state; Stop and Clear actions preserved
- Added logic to gracefully handle pausing and resuming during simulated streaming
- Preserved existing streaming simulation flow and focus/auto-scroll behavior
- Built and committed frontend change (Pause/Resume) to Git (frontend/src/App.jsx)
- Ran environment bootstrap (init.sh) to prepare a frontend static-serving setup (note: full browser-based verification may require bundling in this sandbox)

Tests attempted (core tests for UI):
- Core chat interface loads and renders a clean chat layout with streaming responses (test #1) – not verifiable in this sandbox due to browser automation bridge limitations

Current status: 1 feature implemented; verification pending

Next steps:
- Re-run Step 3 verification with browser automation when the environment allows
- If tests pass, update feature_list.json: mark the relevant test as true
- Commit and push changes, then update feature progress in claude-progress.txt
- UI: updated Clear chat button label to 'Clear chat' (frontend App.jsx) [commit f56cc66]

New content to append:

What I accomplished this session (verification and environment):
- Implemented UI tweak: character/token counts are hidden when the input is empty to satisfy test expectations.
- Committed patch: 17396fc (frontend/src/App.jsx).
- Bootstrapped a lightweight static frontend server (static_server.js) and started on port 5173; PID 92197.
- Verified the static server is serving frontend assets at http://localhost:5173.

Tests performed (UI verification in this sandbox):
- Browser automation verification could not be executed due to sandbox limitations; awaiting environment enablement.

Current status: 2: Patch applied; verification pending.

Next steps:
- Prepare for browser-based verification steps (1-2 tests) in a fully-enabled environment
- If verification passes, update feature_list.json: mark the relevant test as true
- Commit final verification results and progress notes.
