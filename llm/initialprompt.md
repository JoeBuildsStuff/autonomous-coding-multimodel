You are working inside a directory that contains several coding projects.

• `@claude/quickstarts/autonomous-coding/README.md` documents the originalAnthropic Claude autonomous coding agent.
• `autonomous-coding-multimodel/README.md` documents the refactored version that supports OpenAI-compatible models such as ChatGPT and Grok.

Review both READMEs so you understand the architecture and refactor goals, then confirm you can access each directory before proceeding.
